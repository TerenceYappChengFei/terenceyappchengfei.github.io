    <p style="color: #EBF4F6;">My hometown is all the way at Sandakan, Sabah. The seafood there is absolutely delicious
        and I miss it so much! People often claim that seafood in KL is fresh, but I think the seafood in Sandakan is
        even better. with how I have never tasted anything remotely similar to it.</p>
    <p style="color: #EBF4F6;"> I changed from Diploma in Animation
        to Digital Media as I found out that I was more interested in motion graphics and similar subjects. I enjoy
        creating visual content and exploring new design techniques. Whenever I'm not working on projects, I wind down
        by singing and playing the guitar while expanding my musical and art knowledge. </p>
